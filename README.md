# 2D_Game_Engine

I'm making a simple 2D game engine using SDL as my graphics API. This engine was built on an 64 bit Windows environmnet, but since this is SDL we are talking about it could be easily reproduced on *almost* any hardware.

To get this to work you obviously need to link everything and include the right dynamic libraries. 
This is my first time developing a large project in a windows environment, so my github skills are lacking. Hopefully once I finish I can figure out how to make this repo look pretty, and make it easily compilable for anyone curious.
